# Publishing Properties for GitHub Packages
#
# IMPORTANT:
# For publishing to GitHub Packages, it's highly recommended to use
# environment variables, especially when using GitHub Actions:
#   - GITHUB_ACTOR: Your GitHub username (automatically set in Actions)
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN: A Personal Access Token (PAT) with `write:packages` scope.
#                   (The GITHUB_TOKEN provided in Actions usually has this scope for the repo).
#
# The build.gradle.kts is configured to use these environment variables by default.
#
# However, if you need to publish locally and want to use gradle.properties,
# you can define the following in your USER-LEVEL gradle.properties file
# (e.g., ~/.gradle/gradle.properties).
# DO NOT commit your PAT to the repository's gradle.properties.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- GitHub Packages Credentials (User-level gradle.properties if not using ENV variables) ---
# gpr.user=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
# gpr.key=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_WITH_WRITE_PACKAGES_SCOPE

# --- GitHub Repository Details (User-level gradle.properties if you want to override in build script) ---
# You'll also need to replace placeholders in telemetry/build.gradle.kts for the repository URL:
# url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_OR_ORG/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME")

# --- Library Version (Optional - can also be defined in build.gradle.kts) ---
# libraryVersion=1.0.0

# --- Group ID (Optional - can also be defined in build.gradle.kts) ---
# libraryGroupId=io.github.meesum.telemetry
